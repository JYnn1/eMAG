    <h2>Advantages of Vacuum-Packed Food:</h2>
    <p>Recent studies have shown that packing food in a vacuum sealer can increase the time it takes for food to spoil by up to five times. In addition to maintaining freshness, vacuum prevents bacteria and mould from multiplying and retains their nutritional properties. Another benefit of vacuuming your food is that you stop wasting and save money. When we have to throw away food that has gone bad, we don't get to eat it. Don't you love it when foods start smelling like each other? Vacuuming them will prevent this from happening again. No more unpleasant odours when you open the fridge! That's why it's good to choose the most efficient food vacuum possible.</p>

        <li>1. Place the vacuum bag in the correct position indicated in the instructions for use and close the lid.</li>

        <li><strong>NOTE:</strong> It is very important to keep the edges of the bag dry to successfully seal the food. Vacuum packaging is a modern technique used to package and store food. The process of vacuum packaging consists of placing the food in a package made of waterproof material. Gas and air are extracted from the inside with the help of a vacuum pump. This prevents the product from coming into contact with oxygen which can trigger reactions that lead to spoilage of the product.</li>
    </ul>
